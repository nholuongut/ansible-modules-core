## ðŸš€ Getting Started

**NOTE:** As of Ansible 2.3, modules are now in the
[main Ansible repository](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/tree/devel/lib/ansible/modules).

See the [repo merge guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/dev_guide/repomerge.html) for more information.

This repo still exists to allow bug fixes for `stable-2.2` and older releases.
